    <h1>RAIDING RESOURCES</h1>
    <p>Torrent raid times will be at:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Server (West Coast) 6:30 to 9pm.</li>
        <li>Mountain standard: 7:30 to 10pm.</li>
        <li>Central 8:30 to 11pm.</li>
        <li>East Coast 9:30 to Midnight.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now, you can be the best player in the world, with the best gear, and a perfect level of knowledge and comfort in playing your class, but still get completely rocked by an encounter that you do not understand.  If you want to clear an encounter, the #1 priority is surviving it.  In order to survive it you need to know the dangers within it.  To this end, Miles has compiled a <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complete list</a> of guides to every encounter in the current raid.  Additionally, you can be the best player in the world, AND understand every fight with intimate knowledge and practice, but we do not tolerate complete assholes.  Our Generalized rules on raiding come out to:
    <ul>
        <li>Don't be an asshole.</li>
        <li>Let a dead argument lie.</li>
        <li>Keep class/role changes to a minimum during a raid tier.</li>
        <li>If you intend to be core, please make every raid that you can.</li>
    </ul>
    A more detailed list of rules can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, also by Miles.
