      <h1>Welcome to Learn2WoW</h1>
      <p>Hello World! This is a comprehensive guide to Learning how to play WoW!  My biggest recommendation before you get started is to <strong>take it at a comfortable pace for you</strong>.  Learn2WoW was created to be a tool for you to improve yourself at any skill level, in any PvE content.  Most of the content is ordered intentionally, so that the easier and most important things are first, and the harder and more minmax-y stuff comes after.  It is also important to note that as with anything, <em>your skill with WoW takes time to improve</em>.<br><br>I have done my best to put all of the resources I can think of in front of you, and using this information you can become the best you can be.  If you don't want to be cutting edge or anything, there is still value in just reading through sections until it starts to sound a bit too hard or complicated for you. The easiest stuff being first benefits you because once it starts crossing thresholds you aren't interested in, the rest of it won't really be advice that you need.<br><br>Without further introduction: it's time to Learn 2 WoW.</p>
