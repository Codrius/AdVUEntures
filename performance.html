      <h1>IMPROVING YOURSELF</h1>
      <h2>LEARNING HOW TO PLAY YOUR CLASS - RESEARCH</h2>
      <p>I am not immune to thinking "I already know how to play outlaw rogue, I've been playing it for two expansions, it's not that hard!" but you need to kick that urge to skimp on your research.  The tiniest seasonal changes, such as a tierset, new passive, or ESPECIALLY Dragonflight's new talent system can completely shake up how to play your class.  Even if you think you already know how to play your class, <strong><em>everyone</em></strong>, should always be checking to see if the playstyle for their spec has changed at least once a season.  Best case scenario, you do 30% more damage with the same gear.  Worst case scenario, you wasted an hour being told "You're doing it right" and maintain your current damage.  <strong><em>Please</em></strong> do this if you haven't.
      </p><p>
      The best place to learn your spec, no matter what it is, is going to be your <a href="discords.html">class discord</a>.  There are discord servers with hundreds of thousands of members dedicated to being thorough repositories of knowledge on everything about your class.  From how to play it in Raids, M+, or PvP, you can learn directly from people who have PhDs in math and statistical analysis sharing their knowledge that they found from full time work researching the best way to play your spec.  You should trust that they have considered every detail that you have, considered <em>many</em> details that you have not, and have played the class as long as you have if not longer and are generally correct.  They also actively answer any questions that you may have so long as you respect their FAQs.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>MAKING YOUR CLASS PLAYABLE FOR YOU - ALTERNATE PLAYSTYLES</h2>
      <p>It is important to know how you're <em>supposed</em> to play your class before you can learn how to adjust it to be playable for you while losing as little effectiveness as possible.  Perhaps the recommended playstyle has too many procs, or too many buttons, or utilizes a specific talent you have to play around that ruins it for you.  You are not handcuffed to these things, they are simply the optimal.  If it is too much to keep track of or makes things unfun, this is where understanding your class, the talents, how they interact, and where your damage comes from can lead to you making your own concessions for the sake of ease of play or fun.  You are likely not in a mythic raiding guild, nor are you likely attempting to push for #1 on Raider.IO.  You do not need to handcuff yourself to optimal play, but you still need to know what optimal play is to be able to deviate from it without losing more effectiveness than necessary.  8% less damage than optimal can still be 200% more damage than not knowing how to play what you're playing.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>KEEPING TRACK OF YOUR CLASS - WEAKAURAS</h2>
      <p>Not everybody knows how to use weakauras but I guarantee you that everyone can, and that everyone can benefit from them.  Weakauras can help you keep track of every cooldown, every proc, and every nuance involving your class, or even the specific encounter.  While there is some value in learning how to create weakauras, it is <em>much</em> easier to simply use weakauras that other people have already made and 99% of the time, <strong><em>somebody</em></strong> has made a weakaura for whatever you need to track.  Whether it's a trinket with weird mechanics, a fight with weird mechanics, or a class with weird mechanics, a weakaura likely exists to track it. 
      </p><p>
      Finding and using it is as simple as googling "X mechanic weakaura", clicking the first wago.io link, clicking the "Copy import string" button, typing /wa into your game chat, clicking "Import", and pasting in the import string.  Every class has weakauras that will help you track <em>every</em> detail, including your CDs, procs, and <strong>any</strong> weird mechanic involved in any way.  I highly recommend <a href="https://www.luxthos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luxthos</a> class weakauras.  I have personally witnessed people's damage tripling just from using weakauras.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>DEFINITIVE BEST IN SLOTS - FINE TUNING</h2>
      <p>There is a reason this section is halfway down the guide.  A definitive best in slot item may add at the <strong><em>most extreme end</em></strong>, 8-10% damage but more typically 2-5% more damage.  Knowing how to properly play your class will double or triple your damage.  <strong><em>Never</em></strong> try to use gear as a substitute or scapegoat for actually playing correctly.  With the above being noted and addressed first, knowing and targeting your BiS items can contribute greatly to your damage.  BiS items are not "perfectly statted" items, but items with specific passives or mechanics or uniqueness that set them apart from other items.  Most notably, every class usually has best in slot trinkets, and there are quite often weapons with effects that proc.  Your <a href="discords.html">class discord</a> will generally have a list of best in slot items for you to target, and where they come from. If you care about unlocking the potential of your class, these are the things that you will want to for hunt for.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>SIMULATIONS - PRECISION TUNING</h2>
      <p>Once you've addressed all of the above, some people might think that using the proper gear is as simple as "Use the stat priority everyone recommends for my class", but there are a number of reasons why this won't always produce the best result.  First of all, WoW has diminishing marginal returns on stats.  This translates to "The more of X you get, the less valuable X is."  Once you hit 30%, 39%, 47%, 54%, 66%, and 126% in any stat, you hit thresholds where you receive less value from the same additional number of any given stat.  At 126% you cannot gain any more benefit period.  This can vary from class to class, and from stat to stat but this is a generalization.  Additionally, more of a certain stat can make other stats more valuable.  Is your mastery on-hit damage?  Well, the more haste you have, the more valuable mastery becomes.  Simulations exist to bring an answer to the infinite questions that can result from trying to min-max this (And <strong><em>not</em></strong> to substitute for not knowing how to play your class), and can give you an answer as to which item is better between A and B for the way you are specced.  
      </p><p>
      There are two major ways to sim.  The easier of the two is by using the AskMrRobot addon.  To use it, you simply download the addon, click the new icon it created at the corner of your minimap, copy the export string, go to their <a href="https://www.askmrrobot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, create an account, paste in your export string, and use their best in bags feature.  This will not be a simulation, but rather them comparing your gear combinations against millions of simulations that they have pre-run, and them recommending you some setups that get closest to what they presimmed and think would be best for you.  You will only have access to this feature for a single week for free before having to pay for a subscription to keep using it.
      </p><p>
      The second option is using the <a href="https://www.raidbots.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raidbots</a> website with the Simulationcraft addon.  You will download the addon, type "/simc" into your chat, and copy the export text that appears on your screen.  Then you will go to the website, click "Top Gear", and manually select any gear from your bags to be simmed against whatever you're wearing in any possible combination of all selected things.  This will include talents, items, enchants, gems, consumables, and any other misc system that can impact your damage.  It will only sim up to a maximum possible number of combinations per run, so you may need to sim in piecemeal doing something like figuring our your best head, shoulders, pants, and boots in one sim, and then your best weapons and trinkets in the next.  Once you click "Find Top Gear", it will put you into a queue with everyone else attempting to sim at the same time as you, and eventually get to simming your gear for you, outputting what they found produced the highest damage.  Subscribing to Raidbots will allow you to sim a much larger number of possible combinations per sim, and skip the non-subscribers in queue.
      </p><p>
      In both simulators, you will generally want to pay attention to whether you are simming for a raid boss (Patchwerk for raidbots, or Raid for AMR), or for dungeons (Dungeon Slice in Raidbots, or Mythic+ for AMR)</p>
      <br> 
      <h2>COPY THE BEST - MICROSCOPIC TUNING</h2>
      <p>The best players in the world use all of the above tools, but also an ungodly amount of trial, error, and research in knowing what deviations are appropriate specific to the encounter or their team compositions.  You shouldn't be looking to this section generally without addressing the each prior one first, but in order to push your class to it's absolute limits, the final step is in looking at the people who already have and to copy them.
      </p><p>
      For raids, you will look at <a href="https://www.warcraftlogs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WarcraftLogs</a>, click on rankings for a specific boss, and sort by your raid difficulty, class, and spec.  Secondly, you will throw out the top 100 results and maybe even more.  You are not wanting to copy cheesers, whom have an entire raid dedicated to buffing them or setting them up for a perfect DPS padding scenario, but rather the people who are legitimately playing in top form and producing the highest reasonably achievable numbers for your spec on that particular boss.  The goal would be to analyze their report to figure out when they are using their CDs, what kind of gear they are using, what talents they are using, what trinkets they are using, what abilities make up their damage, and copying them to the best of your ability.
      </p><p>
      For dungeons, you will look at <a href="https://raider.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raider.io</a>.  You will mouse over Mythic+, and select your spec on the spec leaderboards.  You will try to copy your preferred playstyle of the people in the top 10 of your spec.  Unlike in raid, the top M+ players cannot pad or cheese.  They are the people who have done the content with the highest damage intake and requirements, and are pushing their classes and comps to their ultimate limits for dungeons.  Check the talents that they run per dungeon, and copy them.  It might vary from player to player, but keep your build adhering to what the top 10 players are playing.
     </p><p>
      It is worth noting that these players tend to play around stat thresholds, and you might not realize why they are gemming and stat enchanting the way that they do.  Perhaps they have haste>vers gems, and a mix of haste and vers enchants.  Why?  Did a sim tell them to do this?  Not necessarily.  When checking their character profile on raider.io or warcraftlogs.com, there will be a button somewhere on the page to show you their armory profile.  This will take you to a page where you can see the actual % numbers of their stats.  If they're at 30% haste and 26% vers, that's exactly why.  They were micro-tuning their stats to hit an exact threshold and dumping the rest into another stat.  These are some things to keep in mind, when you don't exactly understand why they're statting the way that they are, or general thresholds you might try to shoot for (But don't sacrifice too much simmed damage to copy these people.  Generally only try to do things that are not backed by the computers if you know exactly why you are doing it.  In their case, the vers is probably a damage loss in the interest of not being one-shot by high M+ mechanics)</p>
