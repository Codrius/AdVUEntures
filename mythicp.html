      <h1>MYTHIC+ RESOURCES</h1>
      <p>Our guild does not have an official mythic+ team, but we do have a couple of members who have enjoyed hard/high pushing occasionally, and trust us when we say that it is a completely different world from the +10's or +15's you may have been used to if you had never hard pushed before.  Be sure to directly ask me or Gabriel if you have any specific questions pertaining to mythic plus, but also note that neither of us have gone crazy with it in dragonflight specifically.  That said, our experience can still help you push yourself farther, even if not to the cutting edge limits of dragonflight specifically.  Below, I'll try to list out things that you should focus on in order, to improve your M+ game.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>UNDERSTAND THE FUNDAMENTALS OF YOUR DUNGEON</h2>
      <p>There are going to be 8 dungeons per season going forwards, so you'll need to know 8 dungeons worth of boss mechanics.  Less obviously, you're going to want to know 8 dungeons worth of hidden helpful mechanics, and trash mechanics.  For example, in Algeth'Ar Academy, if you talk to NPCs at the start, you can get a permanent buff for either 5% haste, 5% vers, 5% crit, a varying amount of mastery based on class, or 10% additional healing taken.  Many dungeons have hidden mechanics like this and it eventually becomes ESSENTIAL to use them, but it is always greatly helpful to use them no matter what level you're doing the dungeon on.
      </p><p>
      Additionally, understanding trash mechanics is important!  There are some interruptable casts that you should ALWAYS prioritize interrupting over all else.  There are plenty of casts that should be interrupted as much as possible.  There are some casts that need to be stopped with a CC, and some mobs that need to be focused down IMMEDIATELY.  You should watch a general guide on the dungeon that you are running to get an idea of general things to keep an eye out for.</p>

      <h2>UNDERSTAND THE AFFIXES, HOW TO DEAL WITH THEM, AND HOW YOU CAN HELP</h2>
      <p>This entire section requires re-written because 10.1 completely reworked most affixes.  Please check <a href="https://www.mythicpl.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MythicPl.us</a> for current information regarding affixes and how to handle them</p>
      <h2>BEGINNER ADDONS</h2>
      <p>There are some addons that most people can benefit from that are non invasive.  These don't change your UI too much, or demand your attention or computer's resources, but will provide some quality of life in various circumstances.  The ones I would recommend most are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Angry Keystones:  This addon will show you the time left to 3 chest, 2 chest, and 1 chest your key rather than just the vanilla UI showing time to 1 chest the dungeon.  It will also show exact % required, rather than rounded % like the vanilla UI.  It will also show the % any mob gives in the tooltip when you mouse over it (After the first time you kill it with the addon enabled.)  It will also change the linked name of [Mythic Keystone] items into more detailed [Keystone: Azure Vault - Level 4] names.  It will also auto select dialogue options when in a M+ instance, so for things like Azure Vaults where every teleport book has a dialogue option, or in Algeth'ar Academy, where you talk to NPCs to receive their buff, this helps you do that AS FAST AS POSSIBLE.</li>      
        <li>Astral Keys:  This addon will automatically insert your keystone into the pedestal at the beginning of dungeon from your bags (But not automatically activate). It will also network with all other friends, party members, and guildmates that also have the addon so that everyone can know what key everyone else has easily.</li>
        <li>Littlewigs:  Bigwigs for dungeons.  The main reason I have this is because it will automatically chat important information in the spy minigame in court of stars.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>STOP SAVING CDS</h2>
      <p>You will learn that M+ is about speedrunning, not boss meters.  The tank should be pulling the biggest pulls that they can trust the healer to cover and the DPS to kick.  The healers should liberally be using CDs as often as they are useful, and the tank should be considering both his own and the healer's CDs in every pull that they take.  CDs are not oh-shit buttons, they are tools to pull bigger, and clear faster.  Likewise for the DPS.  You should be doing the most damage you can on every pull unless you would waste part of it, or it would be of much GREATER value if you held it for one minute or less.  Trash will make up most of your time spent in the dungeon, especially on fortified weeks.  To speedrun most effectively, you will need to clear as much trash as you can, as fast as you can.</p>
      <h2>EXTEND YOUR CAPABILITIES</h2>
      <p>Eventually, you're going to hit a point where you're going to need to damage one thing while keeping another CC'd or interrupted.  This does <strong>not</strong> have to be a hard thing to do, but you will need a little bit of help.  Personally I use a combination of the addon "Quartz" and <a href="macros.html">macros</a> to stay on top of it.  First of all, Quartz will give you customizable cast bars in your UI.  My main priority is making sure I can clearly see my target's castbar, and my focus's castbar somewhere in the center of my screen, and that it is very visible from a glance whether they are casting something interruptable or non-interruptable.
      </p><p>
      Secondarily, I have one macro to set my target as my focus, and every interrupt and CC in my class has a "Cast at focus" macro.  This means that as long as I designate an important mob as my focus, no matter what I am targeting or doing, with a single keystroke I can cast an appropriate ability at my focus, and thanks to Quartz, I will always know when my target or focused target are casting something that should be kicked or stopped.  It is not a damage loss to hit kick, but it will certainly become a party saver to do so.</p>
      <h2>TIME TO PLAN</h2>
      <p>At a certain point, you can't really wing it anymore.  You're going to have to start planning out your keys with your group.  When keys get high enough, the affixes WILL be impactful enough to change what pulls in what order, with what cooldowns you're going to have to blow.  Tyrannical volcanic week?  That heroism-pull-everything strat in Azure Vault sounds fun!  Fortified bursting week?  For the love of god, please don't.
      </p><p>
      The "Mythic Dungeon Tools" addon exists to help with this.  This addon will provide you a map of every relevant M+ dungeon, populated with every mob in that dungeon and the % that every mob will contribute.  You can organize exactly what pulls you plan to take in what order, make notes, draw, and color code the dungeon in live time with your partymates to prepare your plans ahead of time so that the entirety of the dungeon timer can be spent on execution.  These are sharable through links in the chat to any other player with the addon and most youtubers that provide routes will include an MDT import string in their video description.  <a href="https://www.raider.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raider.io</a> also provides some recommended routes weekly.  <a href="https://raider.io/news/436-the-weekly-route-dragonflight-season-1-basic-routes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This</a> is their current recommended routes for the week.</p>
      <h2>AWARENESS</h2>
      <p>Awareness will be the next essential to work on and once again, more addons are going to help us here.  Everyone is going to want "OmniCD".  It will include an interrupt tracker that will keep you informed of who has a kick up, and who doesn't.  If you have two things in a pull that both require kicked every time (And there are some single pack pulls that are like this), it will become essential to know who has kick off of CD for the sake of being able to tell whose turn it is to kick.  Bonus points if you actually vocally call out kick orders.  Using <a href="https://wago.io/1ctv3b91K" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> weakaura will automatically mark all mobs that need to be interrupted, so active calling such as "I have next moon kick, Gabe gets next circle."  actually becomes possible and viable.
      </p><p>
      A second benefit of OmniCD is that tanks can see every relevant cooldown of a healer to make accurate decisions based on their real cooldown timers.  Likewise, healers can see everyone's defensive CDs and know whether or not they should do something like lay on hands a mage that has ice block up.  DPSes can use this to tell what other DPSes have cooldowns up and whether it would be a waste to blow yours because that fire mage is about to delete this pack in a 5 second window.
      </p><p>
      Nameplate addons can also improve your awareness.  They can help you keep track of whether you're about to pull agro, what you DO have agro on, what every mob in the pull is casting (In the case that more than two things need interrupted and your group is bad, you might have to pick up a third stop or even more, and clicking their nameplate can help).  You can also see important buffs or debuffs on them, so you can know the timers on all your multidotting, or that a particular enemy has a spellstealable/soothable buff.  I personally use Plater</p>
      <h2>EVEN MORE RESEARCH</h2>
      <p>Eventually, you're going to need to add unconventional methods to your toolbox.  Over the course of seasons, people discover insane, weird tricks that make absolutely no sense and save a ton of time.  Did you know in shrine of the storm, if you get on a two seater mount, put the tank on your back, and drag all the mobs from the third boss to the bridge and then step on a specific rock, that they'll all snap into the air, evade and miss, and then reset after 10 seconds?  You could use this to skip multiple annoying packs with stealthsight mobs without using a deathskip/meldskip or any other shenanigans. 
      </p><p>
      You can't trust that you'll figure everything out OR learn it through osmosis.  There are GOING to be tricks that are discovered that will be very helpful, and like everything else, when you've reached a new wall with your current tools, you'll need to discover more tools.  Watching youtube videos of record high key runs will usually show off all of the known tricks to save the absolute most time, but be wary of following their exact routing as they might have a whopping 10 required stops in a pull and are simply co-ordinated enough to handle them.</p>
      <h2>NETWORKING</h2>
      <p>One day, you're going to have to face reality.  Pugs suck.  Always have, always will.  Magically, you'll always find someone with half the skill requirement of where they are and wonder how the hell they brute forced their way there.  There's only gonna be one solution to this problem.  Perform exceptionally in every key you can, and when you see that unicorn of an exceptional player in your party, send them a friend request.  Build a repertoire of other people who care about the game as much as you, who pushed their own limits as much as you, with the same desire to climb as much as you.
      </p><p>
      All it takes is 4 other people that fill the 4 other roles in your party and you can make yourself a push group that will out-compete any pug you've ever played with.  This is the final step in your climbing journey.  Where you end up depends on the standards you hold yourself to and the company you keep.  There's a finite number of people pushing the top 1% of keys, so eventually you might find a sizable clique.  The higher standards you hold them, and yourself to, the higher you'll soar.</p>
